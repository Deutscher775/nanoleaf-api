# nanoleaf-api
A custom Nanoleaf API for extended use or custom controller apps.

# Note
The `panel-layout.png` file does not exist here. I've removed it for security and clarity.
To control stand-alone panels, you need to build a layout yourself, by getting the ID of each indicidual panel.

Also the `nanaleaf-service.py` is in a sperate folder!
